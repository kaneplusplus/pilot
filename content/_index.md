# Experiments for the R Journal

The [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org) is the open access, refereed, journal of the R project. This is a major outlet for articulating new work contributed to the R community, particularly focusing on statistical computing. With the growing popularity of R, the number of submissions to the R Journal has exploded, and alongside this the impact factor of the journal is steadily increasing. The entire journal, from review to production, is produced by the editorial board members.

The R Consortium has provided funds to support the hiring of an editorial assistant, and to experiment with alternative operations to streamline checking compliance of submitted papers, soliciting, constructing and returning reviews, copyediting, construction and web delivery of new issues.
