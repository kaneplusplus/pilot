# Project start

Very excited that this project has been funded by the R Consortium. The new chief editor Norm Matloff is working on hiring editorial assistance. Di Cook and Yihui Xie are going to explore the use of [radix](https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/09/19/radix-for-r-markdown/) for the journal web delivery, and are looking for a research assistant to help.
