<h1>Project start</h1>
<p>Very excited that this project has been funded by the R Consortium. The new chief editor Norm Matloff is working on hiring editorial assistance. Di Cook and Yihui Xie are going to explore the use of <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/09/19/radix-for-r-markdown/">radix</a> for the journal web delivery, and are looking for a research assistant to help.</p>
