<h2>Software development</h2>
<p>Current software development focuses on enhancing the <code>rj</code> package:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>summarise_articles()</code> to help editors check their assignments</li>
<li>additional valid statuses to provide more level of detail of paper progress and AE actions</li>
<li><code>get_submissions()</code> reads information from new google drive storage of paper submissions, acknowledges author by email, constructs the paper directory to load to github.</li>
<li>Extended DESCRIPTION file structure to add keywords, IDs and AEs</li>
<li>Template and guideline files for different actions enhanced</li>
<li>Build issue process fixes, but this needs a major overhaul.</li>
</ul>
